      description:
        "Govee BLE to MQTT bridge — listens for Bluetooth LE Govee sensors and publishes data to your MQTT broker. Uses host networking and DBus for BlueZ BLE stack."
      note: |
        Requires host Bluetooth access and BlueZ running on the host.
        Recommended to run on devices with integrated BLE (e.g. Raspberry Pi).
